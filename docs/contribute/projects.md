# LFDT Projects

!!! draft

    All projects of the LF Decentralized Trust Foundation are classified with one of three stages of maturity. The LFDT TOC uses these criteria to define project maturity:

[Graduated](#Graduated)<br>
[Incubating](#Incubating)<br>
[Labs](#Labs)<br>
[Non-code](#Non-Code)<br>
[Archived](#Archived)<br>

    ## Graduated

Graduated projects represent the most mature stage within the LF Decentralized Trust community. These projects have demonstrated sustained growth, active contributor engagement, production use cases, and strong governance practices. Graduation signals that a project is stable, widely adopted, and operating under the community’s vendor-neutral stewardship. Learn more about the LFDT's [Project Lifecycle](https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/project-lifecycle/?h=lifecycle)}

[Hiero](https://hiero.org) – The LFDT project name for the Hedera codebase, now governed under vendor-neutral stewardship.<br>
[Hyperledger Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/) – An open-source Ethereum client under Apache 2.0, written in Java.<br>
[Hyperledger Cacti](https://hyperledger-cacti.github.io/cacti/) – A tool framework to securely integrate and coordinate different blockchain networks.<br>
[Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/) – A modular, permissioned blockchain framework for enterprise-grade distributed ledger solutions.<br>
[Hyperledger FireFly](https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/) – A “Supernode” stack to enable enterprises to build secure Web3 applications via APIs and orchestrated workflows.<br>
[Hyperledger Indy](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/indy) – A purpose-built distributed ledger for decentralized identities (DIDs), with tools for independent identity solutions.<br>
[Hyperledger Iroha](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/) – A simple, C++–based distributed ledger framework for digital asset management and enterprise usage.<br>



    ## Incubating

Incubating projects are actively growing within the LF Decentralized Trust community. These projects have demonstrated real promise, clear alignment with LFDT’s mission, and early contributor momentum. While still maturing, they are building toward broader adoption and stronger governance as they progress through the lifecycle.  Learn more about the LFDT's [Project Lifecycle](https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/governing-documents/project-lifecycle/?h=lifecycle)}

    ## Labs

LFDT Labs serves as an incubator space where ideas can flourish before moving into formal project status. Labs allow for experimentation, demos, hackathon outputs, or proof-of-concept code. 

Examples of existing Labs:

[Blockchain Explorer](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-explorer/blob/main/README.md) – A tool for exploring blockchain transaction data and network state.<br>
[Blockchain Automation Framework Lab](https://github.com/hyperledger-bevel/bevel/blob/main/README.md) – Tools to streamline deployment and management of blockchain components. *(Formerly the “Blockchain Automation Framework” lab; it moved and was renamed to Hyperledger Bevel.)*<br>
[Solang Lab](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/blob/main/README.md) – Experimental implementation of the Solang compiler in LFDT’s lab environment.<br>
[AI FAQ 2025](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/aifaq/blob/main/README.md) – Research-oriented initiative focused on applying AI to LFDT use cases.<br>
[YUI Lab](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/yui-docs/blob/main/README.md) – Experiments in user interface and developer experience design.<br>
[Agora](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs/agora-key-share-proofs/blob/main/README.md) – A collaborative environment for decentralized governance and decision-making.<br>
[Open Enterprise Agent](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/open-enterprise-agent/blob/main/README.md) – Early exploration of verifiable credential agents for enterprises.<br>

More details on each lab (including descriptions, repositories, and stewards) are available through the [LFDT Labs Github](https://lf-decentralized-trust-labs.github.io/).<br>

  ##Archived
  
Archived projects are no longer actively maintained within the LF Decentralized Trust community. They may have become inactive, been superseded by other efforts, or reached the end of their useful life. While their code and history remain available, these projects are not expected to evolve further under LFDT governance.

  ## Non-code

LFDT encourages contributions beyond code, including:<br>

Documentation Initiatives – Guides, glossaries, or walkthroughs that improve project onboarding, usage, and standards.<br>
Community Outreach – Supporting regional chapters, meetups, mailing lists, Discord engagement, and website content improvements.<br>
Governance & Policy Documents – Contributions to proposal templates, project charter content, branding & guidelines, and codes of conduct.<br>
