# LFDT Projects

!!! draft

    All projects of the LF Decentralized Trust Foundation are classified with one of three stages of maturity. The LFDT TOC uses these criteria to define project maturity:

[Graduated](#Graduated)<br>
[Incubating](#Incubating)<br>
[Labs](#Labs)<br>
[Non-code](#Non-Code)<br>

    ## Graduated
    
[Hyperledger Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/) – An open-source Ethereum client under Apache 2.0, written in Java.<br>
Hyperledger Cacti – A tool framework for securely integrating and coordinating different blockchain networks.<br>
Hyperledger Fabric – A modular, permissioned blockchain framework for enterprise-grade distributed ledger solutions.<br>
Hyperledger FireFly – A “Supernode” stack to enable enterprises to build secure Web3 applications via APIs and orchestrated workflows.<br>
Hyperledger Indy – A purpose-built distributed ledger for decentralized identities (DIDs), with tools for independent identity solutions.<br>
Hyperledger Iroha – A simple, C++–based distributed ledger framework for digital asset management and enterprise usage.<br>
Hiero – The LFDT project name for the Hedera codebase, now governed under vendor-neutral stewardship.<br>

    ## Incubating
Hyperledger AnonCreds – A verifiable credentials format commonly applied in identity systems.<br>
Hyperledger Bevel – A framework scaffolding enterprise blockchain deployments, offering best practices and automation.<br>
Hyperledger Caliper – A benchmarking tool designed to measure performance across blockchain implementations.<br>
CREDEBL – A decentralized identity and verifiable credentials management platform.<br>
Hyperledger Identus – Components and tools for building self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems.<br>
Lockness – A toolkit ecosystem centered on key management and digital signature protocols.<br>
Smoot – A modular interoperability framework supporting cross-blockchain communication.<br>
Solang – A Rust-based Solidity compiler targeting platforms such as Solana and Substrate.<br>
Web3j – A Java/Android reactive library providing smart contract and Ethereum integration.<br>

    ## Labs

LFDT Labs serves as an incubator space where ideas can flourish before moving into formal project status. Labs allow for experimentation, demos, hackathon outputs, or proof-of-concept code.

Examples of existing Labs:

Blockchain Explorer – A tool for exploring blockchain transaction data and network state.<br>
Blockchain Automation Framework Lab – Tools to streamline deployment and management of blockchain components.<br>
Solang Lab – Experimental implementation of the Solang compiler in LFDT’s lab environment.<br>
AI FAQ 2025 – Research-oriented initiative focused on applying AI to LFDT use cases.<br>
YUI Lab – Experiments in user interface and developer experience design.<br>
Agora – A collaborative environment for decentralized governance and decision-making.<br>
Open Enterprise Agent – Early exploration of verifiable credential agents for enterprises.<br>
More details on each lab (including descriptions, repositories, and stewards) are available through the LFDT Labs GitHub organization or Wiki.<br>

  ## Non-code

LFDT encourages contributions beyond code, including:<br>

Documentation Initiatives – Guides, glossaries, or walkthroughs that improve project onboarding, usage, and standards.<br>
Community Outreach – Supporting regional chapters, meetups, mailing lists, Discord engagement, and website content improvements.<br>
Governance & Policy Documents – Contributions to proposal templates, project charter content, branding & guidelines, and codes of conduct.<br>
